# PRITHVI-ANU

"Where Earth Meets the Atom."

PRITHVI-ANU is a nuclear + environment project by that explores low-level radiation detection, nuclear data visualization, and awareness systems for environmental safety. Aligned with BARC’s values of peace through atomic intelligence.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect & visualize simulated radiation data
- Integrate environmental sensors with gamma approximations
- Publish a research model using Arduino/Python

## ⚙️ Stack
- Arduino + GM tube simulation (or equivalent)
- Python + Matplotlib + Firebase
- GIS/Map overlay if needed for visualization
